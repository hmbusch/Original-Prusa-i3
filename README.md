# My Original Prusa i3 MK2S fork

I forked this repository for several purposes and hope to realise these sooner or later.

- Adapt the X-motor-end and the X-idler-end for other lead screw/smooth rod spacings than 17mm. I aim to use the complete MK2S X-axis assembly on my AM8 conversion for the Anet A8. The A8 and the AM8 conversion use a 22mm spacing.
- Make some adjustments to the extruder body to use a 12mm probe instead of the default 8mm PINDA. There are already several versions of this on Thingiverse but no one supplied the SCAD files, even though the licensing requires them to.
- Cleanup the horribly formatted mess of code that Prusa created.
